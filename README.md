# ALMOON

Almoon is a Flutter project that I've started for two reasons:

- To stablish my learning about Flutter & Dart
- As a geek anniversary present for my girlfriend

## What is this project?

This project features a whole bunch of inspirational mottos, written by my girlfriend (hence the gift) the first months of the pandemic and confinement. I have paired each one of these writings with an AI generated image (thanks to Dall-E, LimeWire and Ideogram.ai) trying to represent it. The result is a pretty and minimalistic little app for her, and for everyone who wishes to test it. It will show one inspiration per day, but it will be also possible to see the entire gallery and save favorites.

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it. 

And don't hesitate to learn about Flutter & Dart!

I will post here in the future all the third-party libs and tools I have used.
